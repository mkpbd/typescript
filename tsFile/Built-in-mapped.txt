============== Built-in mapped types ===========
The mapped types we derived in the last section are so useful that TypeScript ships
with many of them built in:
Record<Keys, Values>
An object with keys of type Keys and values of type Values
Partial<Object>
Marks every field in Object as optional
Required<Object>
Marks every field in Object as nonoptional
Readonly<Object>
Marks every field in Object as read-only
Pick<Object, Keys>
Returns a subtype of Object, with just the given Keys
