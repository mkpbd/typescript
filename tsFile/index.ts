let a: number = 1 // a is a number
let b: string = 'hello' // b is a string
let c: boolean[] = [true, false] // c is an array of booleans

//And if you want TypeScript to infer your types for you, just leave them off and let TypeScript get to work:

let aa = 1 // a is a number
let bb = 'hello' // b is a string
let cc = [true, false] // c is an array of booleans
