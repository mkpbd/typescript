"use strict";
let a = 1; // a is a number
let b = 'hello'; // b is a string
let c = [true, false]; // c is an array of booleans
//And if you want TypeScript to infer your types for you, just leave them off and let TypeScript get to work:
let aa = 1; // a is a number
let bb = 'hello'; // b is a string
let cc = [true, false]; // c is an array of booleans
