/**
 *
 * ======================== Property Modifiers ===============================
Each property in an object type can specify a couple of things: the type, whether the property is optional, and whether the property can be written to.

Optional Properties
Much of the time, weâ€™ll find ourselves dealing with objects that might have a property set. In those cases,
we can mark those properties as optional by adding a question mark (?) to the end of their names.
