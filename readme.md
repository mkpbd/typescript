## Getting Started Locally

To install the latest version of TypeScript globally, run the following command:

npm i -g typescript

Now, you’ll be able to run TypeScript on the command line with the tsc (**T**ype**S**cript **C**ompiler) command. Try it with the **--version** flag to make sure it’s set up properly:

tsc --version

## Running Locally

Now that TypeScript is installed, let’s have you set up a folder locally to run TypeScript on code.

Create a folder somewhere on your computer and run this command to create a new **tsconfig.json** configuration file

tsc --init
